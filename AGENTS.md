# Contributor Guidance for `sdk-core`

This repository provides a Rust workspace for the Temporal Core SDK and related crates. Use this
document as your quick reference when submitting pull requests.

## Requirements for coding agents

- Always use `cargo integ-test <test_name>` for running integration tests. Do not run them directly.
  Unit tests may be run with `cargo test`. If you are about to run a test, you do not need to run
  `cargo build` separately first. Just run the test, and it will build. Running `cargo build --test`
  DOES NOT build integration tests. Use `cargo lint` for checking if integration tests compile
  without running them.
- Always use `cargo lint` for checking lints / clippy. Do not use clippy directly.
- It is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that any added comments should explain why something needs to be done,
  rather than what it is. Comments that simply state a fact easily understood from type signatures
  or other context should NEVER be added. Always prefer to avoid a comment unless it truly is 
  clarifying something nonobvious.
- Always make every attempt to avoid explicit sleeps in test code. Instead rely on synchronization
  techniques like channels, Notify, etc.
- Rust compilation can take some time. Do not interrupt builds or tests unless they are taking more
  than 5 minutes. When making changes that may break integration tests, after compiling, run
  integration tests with `timeout 180`, as it is possible to introduce test hangs.


## Repo Specific Utilities

- `.cargo/config.toml` defines useful cargo aliases:
  - `cargo lint` – run clippy on workspace crates and integration tests
  - `cargo test-lint` – run clippy on unit tests
  - `cargo integ-test` – run the integration test runner

## Building and Testing

The following commands are enforced for each pull request (see `README.md`):

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check # ensure code is formatted
cargo build             # build all crates
cargo lint              # run lints
cargo test-lint         # run lints on tests
cargo test              # run unit tests
cargo integ-test        # integration tests (starts ephemeral server by default)
cargo test --test heavy_tests  # load tests -- agents do not need to run this and should not
```

Documentation can be generated with `cargo doc`.

## Expectations for Pull Requests

- Format and lint your code before submitting.
- Ensure all tests pass locally. Integration tests may require a running Temporal server or the
  ephemeral server started by `cargo integ-test`.
- Keep commit messages short and in the imperative mood.
- Provide a clear PR description outlining what changed and why.
- Reviewers expect new features or fixes to include corresponding tests when applicable.

## Review Checklist

Reviewers will look for:

- All builds, tests, and lints passing in CI
    - Note that some tests cause intentional panics. That does not mean the test failed. You should
      only consider tests that have failed according to the harness to be a real problem.
- New tests covering behavior changes
- Clear and concise code following existing style (see `README.md` for error handling guidance)
- Documentation updates for any public API changes

## Where Things Are

- `crates` - All crates in the workspace.
  - `crates/core/` – implementation of the core SDK
  - `crates/client/` – clients for communicating with Temporal clusters
  - `crates/core-api/` – API definitions exposed by core
  - `crates/core-c-bridge/` – C interface for core
  - `crates/sdk/` – Rust SDK built on top of core
  - `crates/sdk-core-protos/` – protobuf definitions shared across crates
  - `crates/fsm/` – state machine implementation and macros
  - `crates/core/tests/` – integration, heavy, and manual tests
- `arch_docs/` – architectural design documents
- Contributor guide: `README.md`
- `target/` - This contains compiled files. You never need to look in here.

## Notes

- Fetch workflow histories with `cargo run --bin histfetch <workflow_id> [run_id]` (binary lives in
  `crates/core/src/histfetch.rs`).
- Protobuf files under `crates/sdk-core-protos/protos/api_upstream` are a git subtree; see
  `README.md` for update instructions.
