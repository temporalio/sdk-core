  // During replay:
  // * If a flag is not recognized (value is too high or not defined), it must fail the workflow
  //   task.
  // * If a flag is recognized, it is stored in a set of used flags for the run. Code checks for
  //   that flag during and after this WFT are allowed to assume that the flag is present.
  // * If a code check for a flag does not find the flag in the set of used flags, it must take
  //   the branch corresponding to the absence of that flag.
  //
  // During non-replay execution of new WFTs:
  // * The SDK is free to use all flags it knows about. It must record any newly-used (IE: not
  //   previously recorded) flags when completing the WFT.
  //
  // SDKs which are too old to even know about this field at all are considered to produce
  // undefined behavior if they replay workflows which used this mechanism.
