// These rules assign a Build ID to Unassigned Workflow Executions and
// Activities.

// Specifically, assignment rules are applied to the following Executions or
// Activities when they are scheduled in a Task Queue:
//    - Generally, any new Workflow Execution, except:
//      - When A Child Workflow or a Continue-As-New Execution inherits the
//        Build ID from its parent/previous execution by setting the
//        `inherit_build_id` flag.
//      - Workflow Executions started Eagerly are assigned to the Build ID of
//        the Starter.
//    - An Activity that is scheduled on a Task Queue different from the one
//      their Workflow runs on, unless the `use_workflow_build_id` flag is set.
//
// In absence of (applicable) redirect rules (`CompatibleBuildIdRedirectRule`s)
// the task will be dispatched to Workers of the Build ID determined by the
// assignment rules. Otherwise, the final Build ID will be determined by the
// redirect rules.
//
// When using Worker Versioning, in the steady state, for a given Task Queue,
// there should typically be exactly one assignment rule to send all Unassigned
// tasks to the latest Build ID. Existence of at least one such "unconditional"
// rule at all times is enforce by the system, unless the `force` flag is used
// by the user when replacing/deleting these rules (for exceptional cases).
//
// During a deployment, one or more additional rules can be added to assign a
// subset of the tasks to a new Build ID based on a "ramp percentage".
//
// When there are multiple assignment rules for a Task Queue, the rules are
// evaluated in order, starting from index 0. The first applicable rule will be
// applied and the rest will be ignored.
//
// In the event that no assignment rule is applicable on a task (or the Task
// Queue is simply not versioned), the tasks will be sent to unversioned
// workers, if available. Otherwise, they remain Unassigned, and will be
// retried for assignment, or dispatch to unversioned workers, at a later time
// depending on the availability of workers.

//  - Need to move long-running Workflow Executions from an old Build ID to a
//    newer one.
//  - Need to hotfix some broken or stuck Workflow Executions.
//
// In steady state, redirect rules are beneficial when dealing with old
// Executions ran on now-decommissioned Build IDs:
//  - To redirecting the Workflow Queries to the current (compatible) Build ID.
//  - To be able to Reset an old Execution so it can run on the current
//    (compatible) Build ID.
//
// Redirect rules can be chained, but only the last rule in the chain can have
// a ramp.
